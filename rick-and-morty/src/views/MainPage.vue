            Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom
            created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's
            nighttime Adult Swim programming block. The series follows the
            misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his
            good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time
            between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.

            Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer
            Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's
            family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of
            Back to the Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film
            festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been acclaimed by
            critics for its originality, creativity and humor.
